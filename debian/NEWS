webkit2gtk (2.10.4+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since webkit2gtk 2.10.4, support for GTK+2-based plugins (Adobe
  Flash, Google Talk/Hangouts) has been moved to a separate package
  called libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37-gtk2.

  This removes the GTK+ 2 dependency from the main libwebkit2gtk package
  and makes it much smaller, so if you don't want to use any of those
  plugins you don't need to install this new package.
