webkit2gtk (2.20.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  webkit2gtk 2.20.0 contains a security feature named Gigacage that
  requires a virtual memory region of several gigabytes and is used for
  variable-length random-access allocations.

  One consequence of this is that webkit-based applications may not run if
  their maximum virtual memory size is restricted (e.g. using ulimit -v).

  If it's not possible to remove the VM size limits the Gigacage can be
  disabled by setting the environment variable GIGACAGE_ENABLED=no. Keep
  in mind that you will be making your system less secure by doing this.

webkit2gtk (2.10.4+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since webkit2gtk 2.10.4, support for GTK+2-based plugins (Adobe
  Flash, Google Talk/Hangouts) has been moved to a separate package
  called libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37-gtk2.

  This removes the GTK+ 2 dependency from the main libwebkit2gtk package
  and makes it much smaller, so if you don't want to use any of those
  plugins you don't need to install this new package.
