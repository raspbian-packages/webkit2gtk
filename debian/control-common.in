Description: JavaScript engine library from WebKitGTK
 JavaScriptCore is the JavaScript engine used in WebKit. It consists
 of the following building blocks: lexer, parser, start-up interpreter
 (LLInt), baseline JIT, a low-latency optimizing JIT (DFG), and a
 high-throughput optimizing JIT (FTL).
 .
 This build comes from the GTK port of WebKit (API version @WK_API_VERSION@).
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Description: Web content engine library for GTK
 WebKit is a web content engine, derived from KHTML and KJS from KDE, and
 used primarily in Apple's Safari browser.  It is made to be embedded in
 other applications, such as mail readers, or web browsers.
 .
 It is able to display content such as HTML, SVG, XML, and others. It also
 supports DOM, XMLHttpRequest, XSLT, CSS, JavaScript/ECMAScript and more.
 .
 WebKitGTK is a WebKit port designed to be used in GTK applications.
 This build provides version @WK_API_VERSION@ of the API and uses libsoup v@SOUP_VERSION@ for
 the networking stack and the GTK @GTK_VERSION@ widget toolkit.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.
